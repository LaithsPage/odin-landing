# odin-landing
Landing Page project from The Odin Project.
For this project, I learned a lot about flexboxes, in particular the use of nested flexboxes to layout a design.
Another important lesson was gaining experience with the nuances of elements and how they interact when it comes to getting them in just the right spot on the web page.
